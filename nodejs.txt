node js is built on chrome v8 javascript engine and uses event driven none blocking model which makes it light weight and efficient.
It is not a framework, it is a platform/ application which runs on server and helps to run javascript programs.

Global objects
Some functions work in node as they used to work in normal jacascript while others have changed
some of the functions which remain same are
	setTimeOut(
	function()
	{
	console.log("3 seconds have passed")
	},3000);


//////////////////////////////////////////
	

	setInterval(function(){

	console.log("2 more seconds have passed")
	},3000);
//////////////////////////////////////////////////
console.log(__dirname);  // will display the directory (without the file name)
console.log(__filename);// Will display the diretcory and file name 

/////////////////////////////////////////////
Modules and require
Module is another jaavscript file


var module=require("./module")
module.export={
	function_name : dummy name which will help us call the function,
	function_name : dummy name which will help us call the function,
	function_name : dummy name which will help us call the function
} ;
